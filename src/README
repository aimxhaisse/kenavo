Despite its poor design, this application follows MVC's pattern, each file in
this folder are prefixed with its roles:

   -- Model files are prefixed with "Model"		: ModelEntity.class.php
   -- View files are prefixed with "View"   		: ViewArticles.php
   -- Controller files are prexifed with "Control" 	: ControlArticles.php

   -- Models are classes, it's easier to deal with data
   -- Views are kind-of templates, parsed by the "asciificator"
   -- Controllers are pure procedural, why would you need object for that?
